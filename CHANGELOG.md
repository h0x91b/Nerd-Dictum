# Changelog

## 2026-05-09

[2026-05-09] Feature — Auto-paste the transcript into the active window via `osascript` (`key code 9 using command down`, the `key code` form so Electron-based targets like Cursor/VS Code accept it). New `autoPasteEnabled` setting, **default off**. Toggle lives in Settings → General; flipping it on triggers `systemPreferences.isTrustedAccessibilityClient(true)` so the macOS Accessibility prompt surfaces immediately instead of after a silently-failed paste. Adds `com.apple.security.automation.apple-events` entitlement and `NSAppleEventsUsageDescription`. Based on @diverru's PR (commit 307cc74) with default flipped to off and explicit permission request on enable.
[2026-05-09] UX — Hook up `playStartSound` to the recording-start path in `App.tsx` so the new ascending blip from the May 6 audio-feedback redesign now actually plays when recording starts (previously the helper was exported but unused). Also revert `playSuccessSound` back to the original two-note ascending chime (800 → 1200 Hz sine) — the band-pass click from the May 6 redesign was less pleasant.
[2026-05-09] Dev — Stop CI Trivy from spamming PR comments with clean reports: when the Trivy summary table shows `0`/`-` for all targets in both Vulnerabilities and Secrets columns, skip the PR comment and add a 👍 reaction to the PR instead; if findings reappear later, the reaction is removed and a fresh comment is posted. Earlier "skip empty file" logic missed reports that contained only the summary table with zero counts
[2026-05-09] Security — Upgrade Electron from 35.7.5 to 42.0.1 to fix 13 vulnerabilities reported by Trivy on PR #11 (4 HIGH, 9 MEDIUM): CVE-2026-34769 through CVE-2026-34779 — covers RCE/security-bypass via undocumented command-line switches, multiple use-after-free issues (PowerMonitor, permission requests, offscreen rendering), HTTP response header injection, protocol handler hijacking, IPC channel spoofing, AppleScript injection in `app.moveToApplicationsFolder`, and information disclosure via crafted second-instance message and iframe origin handling
[2026-05-09] Settings — Default Gemini model changed from `gemini-3-flash-preview` to `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`. Affects `DEFAULT_SETTINGS`, `get-model`/`get-settings` IPC fallbacks, `transcribeAudio()` default param, the SettingsPage placeholder/hint, and the `GEMINI_MODEL` env-var default in README. Existing users with a saved `model` value are unaffected.

## 2026-04-24

[2026-04-24] Bug — Tighten the Gemini transcription prompt so commands addressed to another person stay in the speaker's perspective and imperative mood instead of being rewritten as first-person assistant responses
## 2026-05-06 (diverru fork)

[2026-05-06] Audio — Switched the recorder output format from raw WAV PCM to opus (`audio/webm;codecs=opus`, 24 kbps) for ~10× smaller uploads to Gemini. Optional `retainPcmForWav` flag still produces a 16 kHz mono WAV for downstream local pipelines.

[2026-05-06] UX — Redesigned audio feedback: a new ascending blip on record start (600→900 Hz), a band-pass-filtered noise burst on success (subtle click), and a low double-blip square wave on error.

[2026-05-06] Settings — Dynamic Gemini model list. Settings now fetches `generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models` and surfaces a dropdown filtered to entries that support `generateContent` and start with `gemini-`. "Refresh model list" button to re-fetch; manual override remains available.

## 2026-04-22

[2026-04-22] Bug — Fix `PROHIBITED_CONTENT` safety-filter false positives from Gemini: on safety block, automatically flush the `<previous_transcripts>` context and retry the request once without it before surfacing the error
[2026-04-22] Dev — Surface transcription failures: log every failed Gemini attempt with name/message/statusCode/responseBody (first 2000 chars) in renderer console, and log the final classified error in `App.tsx` — previously errors were silently swallowed between retries
[2026-04-22] Dev — Pass permissive `safetySettings` (`BLOCK_NONE` on all categories) in Gemini requests to reduce spurious safety blocks, and handle `promptFeedback.blockReason` / candidate `finishReason` in the response so blocks produce actionable error messages instead of "Empty response from API"

## 2026-03-29

[2026-03-29] Dev — Stop the CI Trivy PR comment from posting "no vulnerabilities found" noise; empty reports now skip PR comments and delete any stale Trivy comment instead
[2026-03-29] Revert — Remove Gemini Live transcription mode and restore the classic batch-only Gemini transcription flow; deletes live-specific settings, audio playback, and live session handling introduced on 2026-03-28

## 2026-03-27

[2026-03-27] Dev — Switch the macOS release job from a self-hosted runner to the standard GitHub-hosted `macos-15` runner now that the repository is public, and update release/auto-update GitHub config (`release.yml`, `package.json`, `dev-app-update.yml`, `main.ts`) from private to public
[2026-03-27] Dev — Change `bun run dev:mac:tmux` to keep the logs pane in a top/bottom tmux layout by using `split-window -v` with `select-layout even-vertical` instead of the side-by-side `even-horizontal` layout
[2026-03-27] Docs — Update `AGENTS.md` to require immediate commits for completed code/config/docs changes unless the user explicitly asks not to commit yet
[2026-03-27] Docs — Update `AGENTS.md` to require terminal-only Git editors during rebase/merge/commit flows; agents must avoid opening GUI editors and prefer non-interactive Git commands such as `-m`, `--no-edit`, or `GIT_EDITOR=true`
[2026-03-27] Dev — Add `LOCAL_DEV_BUILD` runtime mode for packaged local macOS builds: disables auto-updates, shows `dev` version label, and adds `bun run dev:mac` / `bun run dev:mac:build` workflow; `dev:mac` now launches via `open -W`, captures stdout/stderr to `.dev3/tmp`, stops an existing packaged dev instance before restart, and kills it again when the dev-server process exits, while `dev:mac:tmux` opens a split tmux pane for live logs; update `.dev3/config.json` to use the packaged dev app flow and stop deleting the committed `build/` directory during cleanup

## 2026-02-08
