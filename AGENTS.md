## Project Context

**Nerd Dictum** is a desktop voice-to-text application built for developers and technical professionals.

### The Problem We Solve

Standard speech recognition fails for technical users because:

1. **Technical vocabulary** — Code terms like `kubectl`, `nginx`, `useState`, camelCase identifiers get mangled into common words
2. **Multilingual speech** — Developers often mix languages (English + Hebrew + Russian in one sentence)
3. **Non-standard diction** — Fast speech, mumbling, accents cause misrecognition
4. **Code dictation** — File paths, function names, CLI commands need exact preservation

### Our Solution

We use Google Gemini's multimodal model with prompts engineered for developer speech. The key insight: a language model understands context better than traditional speech-to-text, so it can preserve technical tokens instead of "correcting" them.

## Architecture

```
src/
├── main/           # Electron main process (window management, system tray, IPC)
├── preload/        # Secure bridge between main and renderer
├── renderer/       # React UI (Vite bundled)
└── lib/            # Shared utilities (audio recording, Gemini API)
```

**Data flow:**
1. User clicks button → renderer sends IPC to main
2. Main starts audio recording via native APIs
3. User clicks again → audio encoded as WAV, sent to Gemini
4. Transcript returned → copied to clipboard → UI shows success

## Working on This Codebase

### Before Any Changes

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` for detailed coding standards
2. Check `CHANGELOG.md` for recent work
3. Run `bun run dev` to understand current behavior

### Core Principles

| Principle | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| Bug fixes | Write failing test first, then fix |
| Testability | Every change needs testing instructions |
| Theming | Use CSS tokens (`--bg-*`, `--text-*`), never hardcode colors |
| Changelog | Update `CHANGELOG.md` |

### Common Tasks

**Adding features:**
1. Understand where it fits in the architecture
2. Implement with proper theming tokens
3. Add testing instructions
4. Update changelog

**Fixing bugs:**
1. Write a failing test that reproduces the bug
2. Fix the code
3. Verify test passes
4. Update changelog

**Changing transcription:**
- Prompt is in `src/lib/api/gemini.ts`
- Audio processing in `src/lib/audio/`
- Test with various speech patterns before committing

### Testing

```bash
bun run test        # Unit tests
bun run dev         # Manual testing with hot reload
```

For non-visible changes, use the `log()` function so changes can be verified.

### Logging (Main Process)

In `src/main/main.ts`, use the `log()` function instead of `console.log/error/warn`:

```typescript
log('[Component] Message', data);
```

**Why:** `console.log` only writes to stdout, which is invisible when the app is launched via Finder/Launchpad/Login Items. The `log()` function uses `electron-log` which writes to both stdout AND a file at `~/Library/Logs/Nerd Dictum/main.log`.

**Viewing logs:**
```bash
# Real-time
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/Nerd\ Dictum/main.log

# Or open Console.app → ~/Library/Logs → Nerd Dictum
```

**Format:** Use bracketed component names like `[AutoUpdater]`, `[Settings]`, `[Permissions]`.

## Technical Decisions

**Why Gemini over Whisper/other speech APIs:**
- Multimodal model understands context
- Single API for transcription + domain understanding
- Better at preserving technical tokens

**Gemini API Key:**
- Must be from a personal Gmail account, not a Google Workspace (enterprise) account
- Enterprise accounts may have restrictions that prevent API access

**Why Electron:**
- Cross-platform (macOS, Windows, Linux)
- System tray integration
- Global hotkeys
- Always-on-top floating window

## Target Users

- Multilingual developers (English/Hebrew/Russian common)
- People with non-standard speech patterns
- Anyone dictating technical content who's tired of autocorrect mangling their words
